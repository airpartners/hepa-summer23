# hepa-summer23
Repository for analysis of data from HEPA pilots, beginning in June 2023, last updated June 2024. Supersedes all previous HEPA analysis repositories.

Primary authors of this project are [VedaantKuchhal](https://github.com/VedaantKuchhal),  [sanjatti](https://github.com/sanjatti), [ndhulipala1](https://github.com/ndhulipala1), and [giauyentran](https://github.com/giauyentran).

All of the information relevant to this project is documented in a set of documents called Data Guides. The [main data guide](https://github.com/airpartners/hepa-summer23/blob/main/data_guide.md) can be found as `data_guide.md` and it outlines the entire project and therefore the contents of `cleaning`, `analysis`, `summary`, and `insight` (as well as `data` and `artifacts` - two untracked folders that will be added in the process of running this pipeline).

The main data guide also has location-specific data guides in the `guides/` folder. As of August 4, 2023, this should only have one file, `OH_data_guide.md` which describes all the specific deployments for Olin HAFTRAP. Don't know what that means? Read the [main data guide](https://github.com/airpartners/hepa-summer23/blob/main/data_guide.md)! It's the necessary starting point to understanding and building on this project.

As for the other files/folders, they're fairly boring.

* `.gitignore` un-tracks the files and folders that shouldn't be tracked by git.
* `.img/` contains all the images used in all the data guides in this repository.
* `hepa-summer23.Rproj` is the R Project file. There are many ways to start running the code in this project, but one of the most favorable ways is going to RStudio, clicking on "File --> Open Project" and navigating to and clicking on this file.

Once again, you really just need to read the [data guide](https://github.com/airpartners/hepa-summer23/blob/main/data_guide.md).

Cheers!
