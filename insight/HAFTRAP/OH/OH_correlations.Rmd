# What are the relationships?
In the `analysis` stage, correlation coefficients were computed for every variable for each case for every participant. This notebook explores what we can learn about the relationship (and lack thereof) between different key variables

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Set working directory
```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = 'C:/Users/vkuchhal/Documents/hepa-summer23')
```

```{r}
# Get file path
if (!endsWith(getwd(), "hepa-summer23")) {
  stop("Incorrect working directory")
}
```

```{r}
path_to_data <- "summary/HAFTRAP/OH/"
```

## Summarizing participants
Currently, we have individual correlation coefficients for each participant. Averaging over participants reveals overall coefficients.

### CPC
```{r}
# Read correlation data
filepath <- paste0(path_to_data, "s_OH_C_corr.csv")
cpc_corrs <- read_csv(filepath, show_col_types = FALSE)
```
```{r}
# Group by everything except participant ID
cpc_sum <- cpc_corrs %>%
  group_by(var1, var2, case) %>%
  summarise(mean_cor = mean(cor))
```


```{r}
cpc_relevant <- cpc_sum %>%
  filter(!(var1 == var2)) %>%
  separate_wider_delim(var1, delim = "_", names = c("var1_p", "var1_e")) %>%
  separate_wider_delim(var2, delim = "_", names = c("var2_p", "var2_e"))
```
